    <h5>Part 1 in the collection 2015 Asia trip</h5>



    <a href="../posts/china.html">Next in collection</a>

</div>

<div class="main-text">
    <p>Today marks the end of my three-week trip through parts of China, Japan, and Korea. Most of the trip was spent in Shanghai, with some short but exciting stops in Beijing, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Seoul afterwards. This was my first time in Asia, and my first time travelling alone. Overall I had a really fun time, and the people who showed me around while I was here played no small part in this. I’ll stay away from breathless cliches like &ldquo;it changed my life forever&rdquo;, but visiting Asia definitely opened my eyes to other parts of the world and the preconceptions I had about them.</p>

<p>The trip started with my first trans-oceanic flight since I’ve been old enough to understand the implications of jet lag. When I was in elementary school my parents took me to various places around the world, but back then falling asleep for almost an entire 16-hour flight was pretty easy. And from what I remember as a child, once I was awake I could tap into an energy supply that seems to be throttled these days. Whatever the case, when I was that age my parents made the final decisions about my sleeping schedule and so the burden of planning for jet lag fell squarely upon them.</p>

<p>Now that I’m apparently an adult, however, it was up to me to figure out how to handle a 12-hour jump forwards in time. I asked around for advice from those experienced in such travel, and got a few different opinions. In the end, I stayed up until 5 or 6 am for the 3 days before leaving (for unrelated reasons) and so my hand was forced - I would sleep for most of the trip over. The idea was to try to sleep during the hours for which it was night time in Shanghai. I guess the airline had the same idea, because they served dinner around this time before dimming the lights and asking everybody to close the window.</p>

<p>After sleeping for a few hours, I worried that if I slept any more I wouldn’t be tired enough to sleep at a sane time once I was in Shanghai. In retrospect I have no idea how I arrived at this conclusion, because I crashed pretty hard later that night after arriving. But I guess all the previous sleep deprivation was preventing me from thinking straight.</p>

<p>When I was planning for the flight, I had these high-minded intentions of putting more time into reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which I started reading over a year ago; maybe practicing some drawing afterwards, or killing time by working through some exercises in a set theory textbook. In reality, I ended up binging on in-flight movies, which included the new Spongebob movie, Focus, and the new Nicolas Sparks movie The Longest Ride. I got surprisingly emotional over that last one – I’ll blame that on being sleep deprived too.</p>

<p>One can only watch so many shitty movies before getting bored though, so after a while I started rooting around my backpack for other things to do. I did read some of Zen and the Art of Motorcyle – well, a chapter at least – and did do a little set theory, but crosswords and sudoku ended up being the most effective way to pass the time.</p>
