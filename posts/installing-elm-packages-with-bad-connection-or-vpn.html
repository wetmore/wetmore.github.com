However, using a general-purpose code-hosting website like Github for the specific task of hosting Elm libraries means availability is dependent on Github’s availability. This is a good thing in most cases since Github has a mature infrastructure for serving code worldwide, but it also means that Elm packages are unavailable in China as collateral damage from China’s <a href="http://viewdns.info/chinesefirewall/?domain=github.com" title>blocking of Github</a>, and AFAIK there are no archives for Elm packages elsewhere.</p></div></li></ol></div><p>For the past week and a half I’ve been staying with a friend in Shanghai. Against my better judgment, I’ve been spending some time while she’s at work programming. In particular, I’ve been working with <a href="http://elm-lang.org" title>Elm</a>. Elm comes with a nice local package manager called <a href="https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-package" title><code>elm-package</code></a> which allows you to install packages listed in the <a href="http://package.elm-lang.org" title>official package catalog</a>. The code for the packages themselves is hosted on the package authors’ <a href="http://github.com" title>Github</a> accounts<a id="fnref1" class="fnref" href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>, meaning each public package automatically comes with tools for filing issues, submitting patches, and reviewing source code.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, using <code>elm-package</code> behind a VPN (in my case, <a href="https://www.astrill.com/" title>Astrill</a>) is problematic. Without the VPN in China, you’re stuck, because Github is blocked. With the VPN, you may run into trouble connecting to the Elm package server, like I did. So here is a quick guide to using <code>elm-package</code> in China, or in general, using it with the Astrill VPN. Some of the troubleshooting will also be useful for those with bad connections (how to handle the connection dropping mid-installation, etc).</p>

<p>I will walk through the steps of installing <a href="http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/TheSeamau5/elm-check/latest/" title><code>elm-check</code></a>. At the time of writing this guide, I am using <code>elm-package</code> version <code>0.5.1</code>, which is part of <code>Elm Platform 0.15.1</code>, and Astrill version <code>2.9.3</code>.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-connecting-to-the-package-server">Step 1: Connecting to the package server</h2>

<p>With Astrill running, click the SETTINGS button and enable &ldquo;Smart Mode&rdquo; from the drop down, as pictured:</p>

<div class="captioned-image"><img src="../images/posts/smartmode.png" alt="Smart Mode dropdown"><p class="caption">fig:The Smart Mode option</p></div>

<p>From what I’ve read, Smart Mode will only use the VPN for sites which are blocked in China, so it doesn’t affect the speed of any sites which are not blocked. Curiously, even though the Elm package server is not blocked, I have more success accessing it through the VPN with Smart Mode enabled than I do with the VPN turned off. I don’t know too much about VPNs and such so I’m not sure why this is.</p>

<p>Now, in the directory for your project, run <code>elm-package install TheSeamau5/elm-check</code>. After a few seconds, the package manager will prompt you with:</p>

<pre><code>To install TheSeamau5/elm-check I would like to add the following
dependency to elm-package.json:

    &quot;TheSeamau5/elm-check&quot;: &quot;3.2.0 &lt;= v &lt; 4.0.0&quot;

May I add that to elm-package.json for you? (y/n)</code></pre>

<p>If you get this prompt, answer with a nice <code>y</code>. If you do not get this prompt, and instead the request times out with a failure message, try running <code>elm-package install TheSeamau5/elm-check</code> again. If the request takes more than 10-20 seconds and doesn’t give a timeout message, send an interrupt with ctrl-c and try again. Make sure &ldquo;Smart Mode&rdquo; is enabled in Astrill.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-installing-dependencies">Step 2: Installing dependencies</h2>

<p>After answering <code>y</code>, the next prompt should be</p>

<pre><code>Some new packages are needed. Here is the upgrade plan.

  Install:
    TheSeamau5/elm-check 3.2.0
    TheSeamau5/elm-random-extra 2.1.0
    TheSeamau5/elm-shrink 2.2.1
    TheSeamau5/elm-task-extra 2.0.0
    deadfoxygrandpa/Elm-Test 1.0.4
    elm-lang/core 2.1.0
    evancz/elm-html 3.0.0
    evancz/virtual-dom 1.2.3
    maxsnew/IO 1.0.1

Do you approve of this plan? (y/n)</code></pre>

<p>Once again, tell it <code>y</code>. This is where trouble may crop up. Once you approve the plan, the package manager will begin fetching the versioned packages from Github and installing them into the <code>elm-stuff</code> folder in your directory. The manager will create the directory <code>elm-stuff/packages</code>. For each package, you should see a message, such as</p>

<pre><code>Downloading TheSeamau5/elm-check</code></pre>

<p>Along with this message, the manager will create a directory</p>

<pre><code>elm-stuff/packages/TheSeamau5/elm-check</code></pre>

<p>but this directory will be empty until the package is downloaded. When the download is completed, the package will be added to the directory</p>

<pre><code>elm-stuff/packages/TheSeamau5/elm-check/3.2.0/</code></pre>

<p>and the manager will start downloading the next dependency, and you should see a message telling you that it is downloading a new package.</p>

<p>However, if after, say, a minute, it still just says</p>

<pre><code>Downloading TheSeamau5/elm-check</code></pre>

<p>with no update, your connection has probably dropped, and you should ctrl-c out, and run <code>elm-package install</code>, approve the plan, and let it download again. You do not need to include the package name in the command, because <code>TheSeamau5/elm-check</code> has already been added to <code>elm-package.json</code> for you. You should do the same thing if you get an error message like</p>

<pre><code>Error: failed with 'Error_Packet &quot;partial packet: expecting 1424
bytes, got: 873&quot;' when sending request to
    &lt;http://github.com/TheSeamau5/elm-check/zipball/3.2.0/&gt;</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>Error: failed with 'ResponseTimeout' when sending request to
    &lt;http://github.com/TheSeamau5/elm-check/zipball/3.2.0/&gt;</code></pre>

<div class="sidenote"><ol start="2"><li id="sn2"><div><p>Perhaps it was just my connection and not a general VPN problem, but when I installed <code>elm-check</code> it hung about 3 times during the process.</p></div></li></ol></div><p>With luck, you should be able to download a few packages without problem<a id="fnref2" class="fnref" href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>, but if there are many dependencies to install you will probably run into the problem where installing a particular dependency hangs. But if you’ve installed, say, 4 of the 9 total dependencies before it hangs, and you re-run <code>elm-package install</code>, the package manager will tell you that it plans to install all 9 packages again! Instead of chancing another failure during the process of installing 9 packages, we can manually fix this:</p>

<h2 id="step-3-manually-updating-the-installed-dependency-list">Step 3: Manually updating the installed dependency list</h2>

<p>The Elm package manager uses a file in <code>elm-stuff</code> called <code>exact-dependencies.json</code> to calculate the difference between requested packages in <code>elm-package.json</code> and your currently-installed packages. When you first run <code>elm-package install TheSeamau5/elm-check</code>, it adds this dependency to <code>elm-package.json</code> for you, but during the process of installing each dependency, it doesn’t update <code>exact-dependencies.json</code>. It only updates <code>exact-dependencies.json</code> after it has finished installing all dependencies.</p>

<p>This means that if the installer hangs after installing, say, 4 out of 9 dependencies, it won’t know that it has successfully installed the 4, and will try to install them again when you re-run <code>elm-package install</code>. We can manually create or update <code>exact-dependencies.json</code> so the package manager only installs what we don’t have.</p>

<p>Suppose we run <code>elm-package install</code>, and get to this point:</p>

<pre><code>Downloading TheSeamau5/elm-check
Downloading TheSeamau5/elm-random-extra
Downloading TheSeamau5/elm-shrink
Downloading TheSeamau5/elm-task-extra
Downloading deadfoxygrandpa/Elm-Test
Downloading elm-lang/core</code></pre>

<p>but then it hangs. This means we’ve successfully installed <code>elm-check</code> through <code>Elm-Test</code>, but the installer hung when trying to download <code>core</code>. We can verify that the other packages are installed by checking for them in <code>elm-stuff/packages</code>. Now, open <code>elm-stuff/exact-dependencies.json</code>, or create it if it doesn’t exist. Copy the relevant packages and their versions from the prompt about the upgrade plan we got in <a href="#step-2-installing-dependencies" title>Step 2</a>. In our case, this is</p>

<pre><code>TheSeamau5/elm-check 3.2.0
TheSeamau5/elm-random-extra 2.1.0
TheSeamau5/elm-shrink 2.2.1
TheSeamau5/elm-task-extra 2.0.0
deadfoxygrandpa/Elm-Test 1.0.4</code></pre>

<p>and add this in JSON form to <code>exact-dependencies.json</code> (or edit the preexisting JSON to include the new key/value mappings if the file already exists). Now, the file should look something like:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;TheSeamau5/elm-check&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;3.2.0&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;TheSeamau5/elm-random-extra&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;2.1.0&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;TheSeamau5/elm-shrink&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;2.2.1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;TheSeamau5/elm-task-extra&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;2.0.0&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;deadfoxygrandpa/Elm-Test&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;1.0.4&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Save it, and try re-running <code>elm-package install</code>. Now it should prompt you with</p>

<pre><code>Some new packages are needed. Here is the upgrade plan.

  Install:
    elm-lang/core 2.1.0
    evancz/elm-html 3.0.0
    evancz/virtual-dom 1.2.3
    maxsnew/IO 1.0.1

Do you approve of this plan? (y/n)</code></pre>

<p>Now we only have to install the packages we don’t have yet!</p>

<h2 id="step-4-rinse-and-repeat">Step 4: Rinse and repeat</h2>

<p>You may have to run the previous step a few times, each time adding the packages you’ve successfully installed to <code>exact-dependencies.json</code>, but hopefully it will install a few more packages before failing. When the process finally completes, you will get the message</p>

<pre><code>Packages configured successfully!</code></pre>

<p>and you should be all good. Note that if you check <code>exact-dependencies.json</code> now, the package manager will have mucked with it, probably rearranging the order of the dependencies in the list, but that’s fine.</p>
